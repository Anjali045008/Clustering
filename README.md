**MLM-Project1-Unsupervised-Learning**

**Project Overview**

This project explores a car dataset to gain insights into the distribution of cars based on attributes like year, name, body type, transmission, odometer reading, color, interior type, seller information, wholesale price, selling price, mileage, and condition. Machine learning clustering algorithms will be employed to group similar cars together, aiming to uncover patterns and similarities among different types of cars. By analyzing the resulting clusters, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the characteristics and factors that define various car models and conditions.

**Dataset Description:**

The "Vehicle Sales and Market Trends Dataset" provides a comprehensive collection of information pertaining to the sales transactions of various vehicles. This dataset encompasses details such as the year, make, model, trim, body type, transmission type, VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), state of registration, condition rating, odometer reading, exterior and interior colors, seller information, Manheim Market Report (MMR) values, selling prices, and sale dates.

Key Features:
Vehicle Details: Includes specific information about each vehicle, such as its make, model, trim, and manufacturing year.

Transaction Information: Provides insights into the sales transactions, including selling prices and sale dates.

Market Trends: MMR values offer an estimate of the market value of each vehicle, allowing for analysis of market trends and fluctuations.

Condition and Mileage: Contains data on the condition of the vehicles as well as their odometer readings, enabling analysis of how these factors influence selling prices.
